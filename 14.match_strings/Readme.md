There is a collection of input strings and a collection of query strings. For each query string, determine how many times it occurs in the list of input strings. Return an array of the results.

Example

strings = ['ab', 'ab', 'abc']
queries = ['ab', 'abc', 'bc']

results = [2, 1, 0]

-> There are two instances of ab, one instance of abc, and 0 instances of bc
